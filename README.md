It's the modern-day version of "my dog ate my homework." Good thing the tech industry's got your back thanks to **version control** with **Git** and **GitHub**.

So far, you've been using GitHub to pull labs from [github.com](http://github.com) and download them to your computer to work on. The real power of GitHub comes through doing the exact opposite: creating a project locally (or on your own computer) then saving your code remotely (or on the [github.com](http://github.com) website).

### What is Version Control?
Let's say you're working on an application. You save your work at 5pm. Then you add a couple features and save again at 5:15pm. Then you make another edit and save at 5:30pm. But you realize that 5:30pm save was a huge mistake because you accidentally deleted an important chunk of code. If only you could go back to that 5:15pm version! If you're using **version control** with Git, you can! **Version control** _is the process of storing multiple versions of a single project, allowing each version to be recalled at a later date_. **Git** is the program you'll use for version control on your computer.

###What is Git?

First of all, it’s important to note that Git and GitHub aren’t the same thing. **GitHub** _is a popular remote repository hosting service_. It's where we save our code in the cloud. **Git** _is a version control system that lives on your computer_. Git and Github integrate seamlessly together.

###Git with GitHub
The best way to save your work is to put it on GitHub in a **repository**, which is like an online folder that stores all your code. So how do you get it there?

Go ahead and fork this repository. (Head to the top of this page, click the fork icon, select your GitHub account, and then clone it locally on your computer).

Once you're inside the main directory for this lesson, make a new file called `learning.md`. In that file, type "Hello world!", and save the changes.

Now go back to your terminal. In the directory of this lesson, enter `git status`. You should see something like this:

Git is telling us that we have added a file to our directory, but it also says our changes haven't been tracked yet. Git is smart enough to know we've added a file, but this file and the contents of the file aren't yet ready to head up to the cloud.

We have to individually add files to Git by entering in terminal `git add <name_of_file>`. In this case, we'd type `git add learning.md`. We don't get any feedback from Git, which means our file was successfully added. If we type `git status` again, we see:

<img src="https://after-school-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/git_add.png">

Now we see the line `Changes to be committed:`. So far all we've done is added a file, which is like telling Git, 
"Yes, please keep track of these specific changes." In order to actually save the changes, we have to **commit** them. _A commit is like taking a snapshot of your entire codebase at a moment in time_. Commiting often is a really great habit to develop because you can always rewind in time to different snapshots if you ever break your coode down the road.

To commit, we type `git commit -m "enter a message here"`. The `-m` flag stands for message, which is what gets passed in quotation marks. This is a commit message. A commit message is a description of the work that you've done that accompanies the snapshot. They might be something like "add sidebar to index page" or "create method to multiply two numbers". Commit messages are really helpful because future-you can look at the messages and understand exactly what work you did on your code.

Once you enter your commit, you should see `On branch master Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.` This means your changes have been succesfully committed and a snapshot of your code was taken.

So now it's time to put your code on GitHub. We have to push the code up there with `git push`, which actually sends the code to [github.com](github.com). Now, if you go to this GitHub repository in the browser and refresh the page, you should see `learning.md` up there!

So heres's a summary of that workflow:

* `git add file_name`
* `git commit -m "commit message"`
* `git push`
